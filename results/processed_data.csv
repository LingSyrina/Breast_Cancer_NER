Here, a newly developed size-changeable collagenase-modified polymer micelle is employed to enhance the penetration and retention of nanomedicine in deep tumor tissue.  The TCPPB micelle is first formed by self-assembly of maleimide-terminated poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(β-amino ester) (MAL-PEG-PBAE) and succinic anhydride-modified cisplatin-conjugated poly(ε-caprolactone)-block-poly(ethylene oxide)-triphenylphosphonium (CDDP-PCL-PEO-TPP).  Next, Col-TCPPB NPs are prepd. through a ""click"" chem. combination of thiolated collagenase and maleimide groups on TCPPB micelle.  Finally, biocompatible chondroitin sulfate (CS) is coated to obtain CS/Col-TCPPB NPs for avoiding collagenase inactivation in blood circulation.  In tumor acidic microenvironment, the hydrophobic PBAE segments of the resultant micelles become hydrophilic, leading to a dissocn. and subsequent dissoln. of partial collagenase-contg. components (Col-PEG-PBAE) from NPs.  The dissolved Col-PEG-PBAE promotes the digestion of collagen fibers in tumor tissue like a scavenger, which enhances the NPs penetration.  Simultaneously, the increased hydrophilicity of residual Col-PEG-PBAE in the micellar matrix causes an expansion of the NPs, resulting in an enhanced intratumoral retention.  In tumor cells, the NPs target to release the cisplatin drugs into mitochondria, achieving an excellent anticancer efficacy.","[{'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 530, 'end': 539}, {'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 1503, 'end': 1512}]"

How to maximize the tumor accumulation is still a great challenge in the development of nanocarriers.  Here, we developed a cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-Lys peptide (cRGD) modified and near-IR (NIR) light triggered disintegratable liposomal nanoplatform (PAM/Pt@IcLipo), where photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) was loaded in the out layer and polyamindoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers grafting cisplatin prodrug (PAM/Pt) were encapsulated inside.  The cRGD ligands render the liposomes to target αvβ3 integrin receptors overexpressed by vascular endothelial cells in tumor tissues.  Long blood circulation can be achieved owing to the relative large size (∼162 nm) of the liposomes.  When irradiated by NIR light locally at tumor site, ICG heating detonated the thermosensitive liposomes to release the small sized PAM/Pt nanoparticles (∼8.6 nm), which were capable of penetrating into the deep tumor tissue.  The in vivo results also showed that the PAM/Pt@IcLipo could significantly improve the penetration of cisplatin drug in deep tumor tissues under NIR light irradn., resulting in an excellent antitumor activity.  This nanoplatform solved the dilemma of long blood circulation of large sized nanoparticles and deep penetration of small sized nanoparticles, opening up a new strategy in the development of nanomedicines for cancer therapy.","[{'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 824, 'end': 833}, {'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 1442, 'end': 1451}]"

In the present study, we developed a chemo-photothermal theranostic platform based on polydopamine (PDA)-coated gold nanorods (GNRs).  The PDA coating was thin; however, it significantly suppressed the cytotoxicity of the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide template and allowed high cisplatin loading efficiency, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide (c(RGDyC)) conjugation, and chelator-free iodine-125 labeling (RGD-125IPt-PDA@GNRs).  While loaded cisplatin was released in a pH-sensitive manner, labeled 125I was outstandingly stable under biol. conditions.  RGD-125IPt-PDA@GNRs had a high specificity for αvβ3 integrin, and consequently, they could selectively accumulate in tumors, as revealed by single photon emission computed tomog./CT imaging, and in target tumor angiogenic vessels, as shown by high-resoln. photoacoustic imaging.  As RGD-125IPt-PDA@GNRs targets tumor angiogenesis, it is a highly potent tumor therapy.  Combined chemo-photothermal therapy with probes could thoroughly ablate tumors and inhibit tumor relapse via a synergistic antitumor effect.  Our studies demonstrated that RGD-125IPt-PDA@GNRs is a robust platform for image-guided, chemo-thermal tumor therapy with outstanding synergistic tumor killing and relapse inhibition effects.","[{'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 778, 'end': 787}, {'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 952, 'end': 961}]"

Here, a self-organized three-dimensional (3D) graphene electrode processed by pulsed laser deposition with thermal annealing is reported.  This substrate shows great performance in electron transfer kinetics regarding ferrocene redox probes in soln.  A robust electrografting strategy for covalently attaching a redox probe onto these graphene electrodes is also reported.  The modification protocol consists of a combination of diazonium salt electrografting and click chem.  An alkyne-terminated Ph ring is 1st electrografted onto the self-organized 3-dimensional graphene electrode by in situ electrochem. redn. of 4-ethynylphenyl diazonium.  Then the ethynylphenyl-modified surface efficiently reacts with the redox probe bearing a terminal azide moiety (2-azidoethyl ferrocene) by CuI-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddn.  The authors' modification strategy applied to 3-dimensional graphene electrodes was analyzed by at. force microscopy, SEM, Raman spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and XPS.  For XPS chem. surface anal., special attention was paid to the distribution and chem. state of Fe and N to highlight the functionalization of the graphene-based substrate by electrochem. grafting a ferrocene deriv.  Dense grafting was obsd., offering 4.9 × 10-10 mol cm-2 surface coverage and showing a stable signal over 22 days.  The electrografting was performed as multilayers, which offers higher ferrocene loading than a dense monolayer on a flat surface.

These pleiotropic actions are fundamentally important during development, homeostasis, and tissue regeneration.  HGF signaling also contributes to oncogenesis and tumor progression in several human cancers and promotes aggressive cellular invasiveness that is strongly linked to tumor metastasis.  Our present understanding of c-Met oncogenic signaling supports at least three avenues of pathway selective anticancer drug development: antagonism of ligand/receptor interaction, inhibition of TK catalytic activity, and blockade of intracellular receptor/effector interactions.

HDAC6 is a member of the class IIB HDACs.  It is predominantly cytosolic, microtubule-assocd. α-tubulin deacetylase that is also known to promote aggresome inclusion of the misfolded polyubiquitylated proteins.  Here the authors demonstrate that in the Bcr-abl oncogene expressing human leukemia K562 cells, HDAC6 can be coimmunopptd. with HSP90, and the knock-down of HDAC6 by its siRNA induced the acetylation of HSP90 and α-tubulin.  Depletion of HDAC6 levels also inhibited the binding of HSP90 to ATP, reduced the chaperone assocn. of HSP90 with its client proteins, e.g.  Bcr-Abl, and induced polyubiquitylation and partial depletion of Bcr-Abl.  Conversely, the ectopic overexpression of HDAC6 inhibited LAQ824-induced acetylation of HSP90 and α-tubulin and reduced LAQ824-mediated depletion of Bcr-Abl, AKT, and c-Raf.  Collectively, these findings indicate that HDAC6 is also an HSP90 deacetylase.  Targeted inhibition of HDAC6 leads to acetylation of HSP90 and disruption of its chaperone function, resulting in polyubiquitylation and depletion of pro-growth and pro-survival HSP90 client proteins including Bcr-Abl.

39291812,85,"A review.  Metals are essential cellular components selected by nature to function in several indispensable biochem. processes for living organisms.  Metals are endowed with unique characteristics that include redox activity, variable coordination modes, and reactivity towards org. substrates.  Due to their reactivity, metals are tightly regulated under normal conditions and aberrant metal ion concns. are assocd. with various pathol. disorders, including cancer.  For these reasons, coordination complexes, either as drugs or prodrugs, become very attractive probes as potential anticancer agents.  The use of metals and their salts for medicinal purposes, from iatrochem. to modern day, has been present throughout human history.  The discovery of cisplatin, cis-[PtII(NH3)2Cl2], was a defining moment which triggered the interest in platinum(II)- and other metal-contg. complexes as potential novel anticancer drugs.  Other interests in this field address concerns for uptake, toxicity, and resistance to metallodrugs.  This review article highlights selected metals that have gained considerable interest in both the development and the treatment of cancer.  For example, copper is enriched in various human cancer tissues and is a co-factor essential for tumor angiogenesis processes.  However the use of copper-binding ligands to target tumor copper could provide a novel strategy for cancer selective treatment.  The use of nonessential metals as probes to target mol. pathways as anticancer agents is also emphasized.  Finally, based on the interface between mol. biol. and bioinorg. chem. the design of coordination complexes for cancer treatment is reviewed and design strategies and mechanisms of action are discussed.","[{'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 753, 'end': 762}]"

The dominant paradigm in drug discovery is to design ligands with max. selectivity to act on individual drug targets.  With the target-based approach, many new chem. entities have been discovered, developed, and further approved as drugs.  However, there are a large no. of complex diseases such as cancer that cannot be effectively treated or cured only with one medicine to modulate the biol. function of a single target.  As simultaneous intervention of two (or multiple) cancer progression relevant targets has shown improved therapeutic efficacy, the innovation of multi-targeted drugs has become a promising and prevailing research topic and numerous multi-targeted anticancer agents are currently at various developmental stages.  However, most multi-pharmacophore scaffolds are usually discovered by serendipity or screening, while rational design by combining existing pharmacophore scaffolds remains an enormous challenge.  In this review, four types of multi-pharmacophore modes are discussed, and the examples from literature will be used to introduce attractive lead compds. with the capability of simultaneously interfering with different enzyme or signaling pathway of cancer progression, which will reveal the trends and insights to help the design of the next generation multi-targeted anticancer agents.","[{'entity': 'SAS', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 203, 'end': 206}]"

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is an enzyme involved in base excision repair, a key pathway in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks.  The authors show here that BRCA1 or BRCA2 dysfunction unexpectedly and profoundly sensitizes cells to the inhibition of PARP enzymic activity, resulting in chromosomal instability, cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis.  This seems to be because the inhibition of PARP leads to the persistence of DNA lesions normally repaired by homologous recombination.  These results illustrate how different pathways cooperate to repair damage, and suggest that the targeted inhibition of particular DNA repair pathways may allow the design of specific and less toxic therapies for cancer.","[{'entity': '921', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 4, 'end': 7}]"

This molecular recognition allows Brd4 to associate with acetylated chromatin throughout the cell cycle and regulates transcription at targeted loci.  Recruitment of positive transcription elongation factor b, and possibly the general initiation cofactor Mediator as well, plays an important role in Brd4-regulated transcription.  Selective contacts with acetyl-lysines in nucleosomal histones and chromatin-binding factors likely provide a molecular switch modulating the steps from chromatin targeting to transcriptional regulation, thus further expanding the 'acetylation code' for combinatorial regulation in eukaryotes.","[{'entity': 'H4', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 161, 'end': 163}]"

39292752,572,"268-273 1476-4687 DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) are deleterious lesions, and their incorrect repair can drive cancer development1.  HELQ is a superfamily 2 helicase with 3' to 5' polarity, and its disruption in mice confers germ cells loss, infertility and increased predisposition to ovarian and pituitary tumors2-4.  At the cellular level, defects in HELQ result in hypersensitivity to cisplatin and mitomycin C, and persistence of RAD51 foci after DNA damage3,5.  Notably, HELQ binds to RPA and the RAD51-paralogue BCDX2 complex, but the relevance of these interactions and how HELQ functions in DSB repair remains unclear3,5,6.  Here we show that HELQ helicase activity and a previously unappreciated DNA strand annealing function are differentially regulated by RPA and RAD51.  Using biochem. analyses and single-mol. imaging, we establish that RAD51 forms a complex with and strongly stimulates HELQ as it translocates during DNA unwinding.  By contrast, RPA inhibits DNA unwinding by HELQ but strongly stimulates DNA strand annealing.  Mechanistically, we show that HELQ possesses an intrinsic ability to capture RPA-bound DNA strands and then displace RPA to facilitate annealing of complementary sequences.  Finally, we show that HELQ deficiency in cells compromises single-strand annealing and microhomol.-mediated end-joining pathways and leads to bias towards long-tract gene conversion tracts during homologous recombination.  Thus, our results implicate HELQ in multiple arms of DSB repair through co-factor-dependent modulation of intrinsic translocase and DNA strand annealing activities.","[{'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 392, 'end': 401}]"

Ligands modification through the addn. of support groups (in helping of host-guest main interaction sites) has a key role in the increasing of host mol. adsorption capacity.  To investigate this issue we synthesized two structures TMU-59 and TMU-6(RL1) and studied the effect of MOFs functionalization with functional groups such as Me group in the vicinity of basic amine groups on the detection of guest mols.  The sensing ability of TMU-6(RL1) as parent structure and Me functionalized TMU-59 has studied for the detection of TNP in aq. solns.  Our results reveal that the insertion of Me groups on pillaring linker can remarkably increase the hydrophobicity, stability and electron d. of MOFs as well as maximizing the interaction with the nitro-aroms. guests by providing multiple adsorption mechanisms such as hydrogen bonds and π-π interactions.  The detection limit for TNP in water solvent is 0.46 and 102 ppb for TMU-59 and TMU-6(RL), resp.  Present work as a comprehensive study reveals that how MOFs functionalization through the addn. of relatively active group such as Me would have influenced the overall sensing behavior.","[{'entity': 'RL', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1241, 'end': 1243}]"

Clinical microarray results demonstrated that increased levels of vimentin mRNA after chemotherapy correlated to a poor prognosis of breast cancer patients.  We hypothesized that vimentin mediated the reorganization of cytoskeletons to maintain the mechanical integrity in EMT cancer cells.  By using knockdown strategy, the results showed reduced cell proliferation, impaired wound healing, loss of directional migration, and increased large membrane extension in MDA-MB 231 cells.  Vimentin depletion also induced reorganization of cytoskeletons and reduced focal adhesions, which resulted in impaired mechanical strength because of reduced cell stiffness and contractile force.  In addition, overexpressing vimentin in MCF7 cells increased cell stiffness, elevated cell motility and directional migration, reoriented microtubule polarity, and increased EMT phenotypes due to the increased β1-integrin and the loss of junction protein E-cadherin.  The EMT-related transcription factor slug was also mediated by vimentin.  The current study demonstrated that vimentin serves as a regulator to maintain intracellular mechanical homeostasis by mediating cytoskeleton architecture and the balance of cell force generation in EMT cancer cells.","[{'entity': 'MCF7', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1322, 'end': 1326}]"

39346823,297,"917-921 NATUAS 0028-0836 Nature Publishing Group BRCA1 and BRCA2 are important for DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination, and mutations in these genes predispose to breast and other cancers.  Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is an enzyme involved in base excision repair, a key pathway in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks.  The authors show here that BRCA1 or BRCA2 dysfunction unexpectedly and profoundly sensitizes cells to the inhibition of PARP enzymic activity, resulting in chromosomal instability, cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis.  This seems to be because the inhibition of PARP leads to the persistence of DNA lesions normally repaired by homologous recombination.  These results illustrate how different pathways cooperate to repair damage, and suggest that the targeted inhibition of particular DNA repair pathways may allow the design of specific and less toxic therapies for cancer.","[{'entity': '921', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 4, 'end': 7}]"

However, most approved PARP inhibitors have lower selectivity to PARP-1 than to PARP-2, so they will inevitably have side effects.  Based on the different catalytic domains of PARP-1 and PARP-2, we developed a strategy to design and synthesize highly selective PARP-1 inhibitors.  A few selected compds. (labeled Y17, Y29, Y31 and Y49) showed excellent PARP-1 inhibition, and their IC50 values were 0.61, 0.66, 0.41 and 0.96 nM, resp.

Long pepper is one of the most widely used in Ayurvedic medicine, which is used to treat many diseases, including tumors.  The purpose of the current paper is to address to the chem. structure establishment and to systematically survey the published articles and highlight recent advances in the knowledge of the therapeutic potential of piplartine, establishing new goals for future research.  The reported pharmacol. activities of piplartine include cytotoxic, genotoxic, antitumor, antiangiogenic, antimetastatic, antiplatelet aggregation, antinociceptive, anxiolytic, antidepressant, anti-atherosclerotic, antidiabetic, antibacterial, antifungal, leishmanicidal, trypanocidal, and schistosomicidal activities.  Among the multiple pharmacol. effects of piplartine, its anticancer property is the most promising.  Therefore, the preclin. anticancer potential of piplartine has been extensively investigated, which recently resulted in one patent.  This compd. is selectively cytotoxic against cancer cells by induction of oxidative stress, induces genotoxicity, as an alternative strategy to killing tumor cells, has excellent oral bioavailability in mice, inhibits tumor growth in mice, and presents only weak systemic toxicity.  In summary, we conclude that piplartine is effective for use in cancer therapy and its safety using chronic toxicol. studies should be addressed to support the viability of clin. trials.","[{'entity': 'Piperlongumine', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 629, 'end': 639}, {'entity': 'Piperlongumine', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 724, 'end': 734}, {'entity': 'Piperlongumine', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 1047, 'end': 1057}, {'entity': 'Piperlongumine', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 1155, 'end': 1165}, {'entity': 'Piperlongumine', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 1553, 'end': 1563}]"

Although was discovered well over fifty years ago, its pharmacol. properties have been uncovered in the past decade.  In particular, piperlongumine has been most extensively studied as a potential anticancer agent.  Piperlongumine has exhibited cytotoxicity against a broad spectrum of human cancer cell lines, as well as demonstrated antitumor activity in rodents.  Piperlongumine has also been found to be a proapoptotic, anti-invasive, antiangiogenic agent and synergize with modern chemotherapeutic agents.  Because of its clin. potential, several studies were undertaken to obtain piperlongumine analogs, which have exhibited more potent activity or more appropriate drug-like parameters.  In this review, the synthesis of piperlongumine analogs and piperlongumine-based hybrid compds., as well as their anticancer properties and the mol. basis for their activity are explored.

(SPAAC) allowed for the functionalization of the BBCPs with the piplartine (PPT) moiety, a natural product with well-documented cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines, via an ester linker between the drug and the polymer side chain.  The amphiphilic BBCPs self-assembled in aq. media into nano-sized spherical micelles with neutral surface charges, as confirmed by dynamic light scattering anal. and transmission electron microscopy.  During self-assembly, paclitaxel (PTX) could be effectively encapsulated into the hydrophobic core to form stable PTX-loaded micelles with high loading capacities and encapsulation efficiencies.  The NIR fluorescent dye-contg. micelles exhibited remarkable photophys. properties, excellent colloidal stability under physiol. conditions, and a pH-induced disassembly under slightly acidic conditions, allowing for the release of the drug in a controlled manner.  The in vitro studies demonstrated that the micelles without the drug (blank micelles) are biocompatible at concns. of up to 1 mg mL-1 and present a high cellular internalization capacity toward MCF-7 cancer cells.  The drug-functionalized micelles showed in vitro cytotoxicity comparable to free PPT and PTX against MCF-7 and PC3 cancer cells, confirming efficient drug release into the tumor environment upon cellular internalization.  Furthermore, the drug-functionalized micelles exhibited higher selectivity than the pristine drugs and preferential cellular uptake in human cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and PC3) when compared to the normal breast cell line (MCF10A).  This study provides an efficient strategy for the development of versatile polymeric nanosystems for drug delivery and image-guided diagnostics.

The median-effect equation derived from the mass-action law principle at equil. steady state via math. induction and deduction for different reaction sequences and mechanisms and different types of inhibition has been shown to be the unified theory for the Michaelis-Menten equation, Hill equation, Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and Scatchard equation.  It is shown that dose and effect are interchangeable via defined parameters.  This general equation for the single drug effect has been extended to the multiple drug effect equation for n drugs.  These equations provide the theor. basis for the combination index (CI)-isobologram equation that allows quant. detn. of drug interactions, where CI < 1, = 1, and > 1 indicate synergism, additive effect, and antagonism, resp.  Based on these algorithms, computer software has been developed to allow automated simulation of synergism and antagonism at all dose or effect levels.  It displays the dose-effect curve, median-effect plot, combination index plot, isobologram, dose-redn. index plot, and polygonogram for in vitro or in vivo studies.  This theor. development, exptl. design, and computerized data anal. have facilitated dose-effect anal. for single drug evaluation or carcinogen and radiation risk assessment, as well as for drug or other entity combinations in a vast field of disciplines of biomedical sciences.  In this review, selected examples of applications are given, and step-by-step examples of exptl. designs and real data anal. are also illustrated.  The merging of the mass-action law principle with math. induction-deduction has been proven to be a unique and effective scientific method for general theory development.

Aim was to evaluate the anticancer effects of SA in PC-3 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.  The effect of SA on cell viability was detd. using XTT assay.  Expressions of 8 genes for apoptosis and 6 genes for metastasis were evaluated by qPCR.  Caspase-3 activity was detd. using caspase-3 colorimetric assay kit.  Effect of SA on cell invasion was evaluated with cell invasion assay.  The IC50 dose of SA in PC-3 and LNCaP cells was found to be 1000μM for 72h.  SA treatment increased the expression of BAX, CASP3, CASP8, CYCS, FAS, TIMP-1 and CDH1 however significantly decreased the expression of MMP-9 in PC-3 cells.  In LNCaP cells, the expressions of BAX, CASP3, CASP7 and CYCS were significantly elevated; however, a decrease was seen in the expressions of CDH2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the SA treatment.  Moreover, SA significantly increased caspase-3 activity and suppressed the cell invasion.  In conclusion, it is thought that SA has anticancer effect on prostate cancer cells.  However, more detailed studies should be conduct to illuminate mol. mechanism of apoptotic and antimetastatic activity of SA.","[{'entity': '72h', 'type': 'Incubation Time (hour)', 'start': 885, 'end': 888}]"

39371991,400,"The oncoprotective role of food-derived polyphenol antioxidants has been described but the implicated mechanisms are not yet clear.  In addn. to polyphenols, phenolic acids, found at high concns. in a no. of plants, possess antioxidant action.  The main phenolic acids found in foods are derivs. of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-hydroxycinnamic acid.  This work concs. on the antiproliferative action of caffeic acid, syringic acid, sinapic acid, protocatechuic acid, ferulic acid and 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (PAA) on T47D human breast cancer cells, testing their antioxidant activity and a no. of possible mechanisms involved (interaction with membrane and intracellular receptors, nitric oxide prodn.).  The tested compds. showed a time-dependent and dose-dependent inhibitory effect on cell growth with the following potency: caffeic acid > ferulic acid = protocatechuic acid = PAA > sinapic acid = syringic acid.  Caffeic acid and PAA were chosen for further anal.  The antioxidative activity of these phenolic acids in T47D cells does not coincide with their inhibitory effect on tumoral proliferation.  No interaction was found with steroid and adrenergic receptors.  PAA induced an inhibition of nitric oxide synthase, while caffeic acid competes for binding and results in an inhibition of arylhydrocarbon receptor-induced CYP1A1 enzyme.  Both agents induce apoptosis via the Fas/FasL system.  Phenolic acids exert a direct antiproliferative action, evident at low concns., comparable with those found in biol. fluids after ingestion of foods rich inphenolic acids.  Furthermore, the direct interaction with the arylhydrocarbon receptor, the nitric oxide synthase inhibition and their pro-apoptotic effect provide some insights into theirbiol. mode of action.","[{'entity': 'T47D', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 524, 'end': 528}, {'entity': 'T47D', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1030, 'end': 1034}]"

However, their practical applicability in cancer therapeutics is limited by their insensitive surface properties to complicated tumor microenvironment in vivo.  Herein, a tumor extracellular microenvironment-responsive drug nanocarrier based on cisplatin(IV) prodrug-loaded charge-convertible CDs (CDs-Pt(IV)@PEG-(PAH/DMMA)) was developed for imaging-guided drug delivery.  An anionic polymer with dimethylmaleic acid (PEG-(PAH/DMMA)) on the fabricated CDs-Pt(IV)@PEG-(PAH/DMMA) could undergo intriguing charge conversion to a cationic polymer in mildly acidic tumor extracellular microenvironment (pH ∼ 6.8), leading to strong electrostatic repulsion and release of pos.

GO Is an appealing nanomaterial for potential clin. applications combining drug delivery and photothermal therapy in a single nano-device capable of specifically targeting breast cancer cells.  However, native GO sheets have large dimensions (0.5-5μm) such that tumor accumulation after a systemic administration is usually precluded.  Herein, we report a step-by-step synthesis of folic acid-functionalized PEGylated GO, henceforth named GO-PEG-Fol, with small size and narrow size distribution (∼30 ± 5 nm), and the ability of efficiently converting NIR light into heat.  GO-PEG-Fol Consists of a nano-GO sheet, obtained by fragmentation of GO by means of non-equil. plasma etching, fully functionalized with folic acid-terminated PEG2000 chains through amidic coupling and azide-alkyne click cycloaddn., which we showed as active targeting agents to selectively recognize breast cancer cells such as MCF7 and MDA-MB-231.  The GO-PEG-Fol incorporated a high amt. of doxorubicin hydrochloride (Doxo) (>33%) and behaves as NIR-light-activated heater capable of triggering sudden Doxo delivery inside cancer cells and localized hyperthermia, thus provoking efficient breast cancer death.  The cytotoxic effect was found to be selective for breast cancer cells, being the IC50 up to 12 times lower than that obsd. for healthy fibroblasts.  This work established plasma etching as a cost-effective strategy to get functionalized nano-GO with a smart combination of properties such as small size, good photothermal efficiency and targeted cytotoxic effect, which make it a promising candidate as photothermal agent for the treatment of breast cancer.","[{'entity': 'MCF7', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1603, 'end': 1607}]"

Meta-analyses were conducted using RevMan v5.0 and STATA v12.0.  Results: Fourteen publications with 2951 cases were included.  The incidence of high CD73 expression was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.36-0.63).  Data from Oncomine validated that median CD73 expression level in tumor tissues was markedly higher than that in normal tissues in most kinds of cancers except cecum adenocarcinoma and ovarian cancer (P < 0.05).  High CD73 expression was significantly correlated with shorter overall survival (OS) in various cancers (high risk [HR] = 1.48; P < 0.05).  Subgroup anal. using online database demonstrated that high CD73 expression was significantly correlated with poor OS in breast (HR = 1.23; P < 0.05) and ovarian cancer (HR = 1.14; P < 0.05), but favorable OS in lung (HR = 0.80; P < 0.05) and gastric cancer (HR = 0.71; P < 0.05).  High CD73 expression was dramatically assocd. with lymph node metastases (OR = 2.61; P = 0.05).  Conclusion: High CD73 expression was significantly assocd. with lymph node metastases and a promising prognostic factor in different types of cancers.","[{'entity': 'CI', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 728, 'end': 730}]"

The purinergic signaling has drawn attention from academia and more recently from pharmaceutical industries as a potential therapeutic route for cancer treatment, since ATP may act as chemotactic agent and possess in vitro antineoplastic activity.  On the other way, adenosine, produced in extracellular medium by ecto-5'-NT, acts as immunosuppressor and is related to neoangiogenesis, vasculogenesis and evasion to the immune system.  Consequently, inhibitors of ecto-5'-NT may prevent tumor progression, reducing adenosine concns., preventing escape from the host's immune system and slowing cancer's growth.  This review aims to highlight important biochem. and structural features of ecto-5'NT, highlight its expression profile in normal and cancer cell lines detailing compds. which may act as expression regulators and to review the several classes of ecto-5'NT inhibitors developed in the past 12 years, in order to build a general structure-activity relationship model to guide further compd. design.","[{'entity': 'SAS', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 370, 'end': 373}]"

Chemotherapy is one of the most common treatments for cancer that uses one or more anti-cancer drugs as a part of the standardized chemotherapy regimen.  Cytotoxic chems. delay and prevent cancer cells from multiplying, invading, and metastasizing.  However, the significant drawbacks of cancer chemotherapy are the lack of selectivity of the cytotoxic drugs to tumor cells and normal cells and the development of resistance by cells for the particular drug or the combination of drugs.  Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the low sensitivity of specific cells against drugs assocd. with cancer chemotherapy.  The most common mechanisms of anticancer drug resistance are: (a) drug-dependent MDR (b) target-dependent MDR, and (c) drug target-independent MDR.  In all the factors, the overexpression of multidrug efflux systems contributes significantly to the increased resistance in the cancer cells.  Multidrug resistance due to efflux of anticancer drugs by membrane ABC transporters includes ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2.  ABCB1 inhibition can restore the sensitivity of the cancerous cells toward chemotherapeutic drugs.  In this review, we discussed ABCB1 inhibitors under clin. studies with their mode of action, potency and selectivity.  Also, we have highlighted the contribution of repurposing drugs, biologics and nano formulation strategies to combat multidrug resistance by modulating the ABCB1 activity.","[{'entity': 'SAS', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 121, 'end': 124}]"
39387174,269,"Cell Death & Disease CDDEA4 2041-4889 Nature Publishing Group The angiogenesis inhibitor sunitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that acts mainly on the VEGF and PDGF pathways.  We have previously shown that sunitinib is sequestered in the lysosomes of exposed tumor and endothelial cells.  This phenomenon is part of the drug-induced resistance obsd. in the clinic.  Here, we demonstrate that when exposed to light, sequestered sunitinib causes immediate destruction of the lysosomes, resulting in the release of sunitinib and cell death.  We hypothesized that this photoactivation of sunitinib could be used as a vaso-occlusive vascular-targeting approach to treating cancer.  Spectral properties of sunitinib and its lysosomal accumulation were measured in vitro.  The human A2780 ovarian carcinoma transplanted onto the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and the Colo-26 colorectal carcinoma model in Balb/c mice were used to test the effects of administrating sunitinib and subsequently exposing tumor tissue to light.  Tumors were subsequently resected and subject to immunohistochem. anal.  In A2780 ovarian carcinoma tumors, treatment with sunitinib+light resulted in immediate specific angio-occlusion, leading to a necrotic tumor mass 24 h after treatment.  Tumor growth was inhibited by 70% as compared with the control group (**P<0.0001).  Similar observations were made in the Colo-26 colorectal carcinoma, where light exposure of the sunitinib-treated mice inhibited tumor growth by 50% as compared with the control and by 25% as compared with sunitinib-only-treated tumors (N≥4; P=0.0002).  Histol. revealed that photoactivation of sunitinib resulted in a change in tumor vessel architecture.  The current results suggest that the spectral properties of sunitinib can be exploited for application against certain cancer indications.","[{'entity': 'A2780', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 779, 'end': 784}, {'entity': 'A2780', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1106, 'end': 1111}]"

39388598,781,"23 to 100% of patients with ovarian cancer achieved complete or partial responses with paclitaxel in combination with cisplatin, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, altretamine and/or doxorubicin.  Similarly, response rates of 30 to 100% were observed with paclitaxel plus doxorubicin, cisplatin, mitoxantrone and/or cyclophosphamide in patients with metastatic breast cancer.  Comparative trials in patients with advanced ovarian cancer showed paclitaxel therapy to produce greater response rates than treatment with parenteral hydroxyurea (71 vs 0%) or cyclophosphamide (when both agents were combined with cisplatin) [79 vs 63%].  Paclitaxel was also more effective than mitomycin in 50 patients with previously untreated breast cancer (partial response in 20 vs 4% of patients).  Paclitaxel therapy also produced promising results in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, malignant melanoma, advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), germ cell cancer, urothelial cancer, oesophageal cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and was successfully combined with cisplatin, carboplatin and/or etoposide in patients with NSCLC, SCLC or advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.  Hypersensitivity reactions were initially a concern with administration of paclitaxel, although current dosage regimens have reduced the incidence of these events to less than 5%.  The major dose-limiting adverse effects of paclitaxel are leucopenia (neutropenia) and peripheral neuropathy.  Other haematological toxicity was generally mild.  Cardiac toxicity was reported in small numbers of patients and most patients developed total alopecia.  Several aspects of paclitaxel use remain to be clarified, including the optimal treatment schedule and infusion time, confirmation of the tolerability profile and efficacy of combination regimens in an expanded range of malignancies.  Long term follow-up of paclitaxel recipients will also allow the effects of the drug on patient survival to be determined.  Nevertheless, paclitaxel is a promising addition to the current therapies available, with significant activity reported in patients with advanced ovarian or breast cancer or other types of tumors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)                 10.1016/S0378-5173(01)00986-3","[{'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 118, 'end': 127}, {'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 281, 'end': 290}, {'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 604, 'end': 613}, {'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 1134, 'end': 1143}]"

Therefore, it is imperative to find biostable and cell-permeable peptide drugs for cancer treatment.  Here, we identified a potent, selective, biostable, and cell-permeable cyclic D-peptide, NKTP-3, that targets NRP1 and KRASG12D using structure-based virtual screening.  NKTP-3 exhibited strong biostability and cellular uptake ability.  Importantly, it significantly inhibited the growth of A427 cells with the KRASG12D mutation.  Moreover, NKTP-3 showed strong antitumor activity against A427 cell-derived xenograft and KRASG12D-driven primary lung cancer models without obvious toxicity.  This study demonstrates that the dual NRP1/KRASG12D-targeting cyclic D-peptide NKTP-3 may be used as a potential chemotherapeutic agent for KRASG12D-driven lung cancer treatment.","[{'entity': 'A427', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 843, 'end': 847}, {'entity': 'A427', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 941, 'end': 945}]"

In vivo antitumor treatments indicated TSPDSs not only provided high antitumor efficiency which was comparable to clin. cisplatin, but also reduced renal toxicity of platinum-based drugs.  Moreover, NIR fluorescence of TSPDSs successfully visualized in vitro and in vivo fate of nanoplatforms and disclosed the intracellular platinum delivery and pharmacokinetics.

Radiation therapy promotes leakage of electrons from the electron transport chain and leads to an increase in mitochondrial prodn. of the superoxide anion which is converted to hydrogen peroxide by superoxide dismutase.  Iron oxide nanoparticles can then catalyze the reaction from hydrogen peroxide to the highly reactive hydroxyl radical.  Therefore, the overall aim of this project was to utilize iron oxide nanoparticles conjugated to a cell penetrating peptide, TAT, to escape lysosomal encapsulation after internalization by cancer cells and catalyze hydroxyl radical formation.  It was detd. that TAT functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles and uncoated iron oxide nanoparticles resulted in permeabilization of the lysosomal membranes.  Addnl., mitochondrial integrity was compromised when A549 cells were treated with both TAT-functionalized nanoparticles and radiation.  Pre-treatment with TAT-functionalized nanoparticles also significantly increased the ROS generation assocd. with radiation.  A long term viability study showed that TAT-functionalized nanoparticles combined with radiation resulted in a synergistic combination treatment.  This is likely due to the TAT-functionalized nanoparticles sensitizing the cells to subsequent radiation therapy, because the nanoparticles alone did not result in significant toxicities.","[{'entity': 'A549', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 938, 'end': 942}]"

The great clin. success of cisplatin and its derivs. has convinced people that metal complexes could play a more significant role in human cancer therapy.  However, targeting and drug resistance are still two dominant problems that need to be urgently solved for metallodrugs' efficacy and clin. translation.  As an important component of metal complexes, organometallics have been experiencing rapid development in recent years.  Compared with platinum drugs, emerging anti-tumor organometallics targeting dynamic bioprocesses provide an effective strategy to overcome conventional problems.  This review focuses on burgeoning anti-tumor strategies and provides up-to-date advances in anti-tumor organometallics development based on their action mechanisms.  Specifically, important tumor-overexpressed proteins and nucleic acids as organometallics' anti-tumor targets are systematically presented, followed by organometallics that exert their anti-tumor activity by perturbing tumor intracellular energy/redox/metal/immune homeostasis.  Finally, nine cell death pathways including apoptosis, paraptosis, autophagy, oncosis, necrosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and immunogenic cell death (ICD) that can be induced by organometallics are reviewed, and their morphol. and biochem. features are summarised.  This review at the interface of chem., biol., and medicine aims to enlighten the rational development of organometallic anti-tumor agents.","[{'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 319, 'end': 328}]"

However, the interfacial defects between org.-inorg. phases commonly lead to the crack propagation and fracture failure of these materials under stress.  A natural biomineral, bone, has much higher bending toughness than the nacre.  The small size of inorg. building units in bone improves the org.-inorg. interaction, which optimizes the material toughness.  Inspired by these biol. structures, here, an ultratough nanocomposite laminate is prepd. by the integration of ultrasmall calcium phosphate oligomers (CPO, 1 nm in diam.) within poly(vinyl alc.) (PVA) and sodium alginate (Alg) networks through a simple three-step strategy.  Owing to the small size of inorg. building units, strong multiple mol. interactions within integrated org.-inorg. hierarchical structure are built.  The resulting laminates exhibit ultrahigh bending strain (>50% without fracture) and toughness (21.5-31.0 MJ m-3), which surpass natural nacre and almost all of the synthetic laminate materials that have been reported so far.  Moreover, the mechanics of this laminate is tunable by changing the water content within the bulk structure.  This work provides a way for the development of org.-inorg. nanocomposites with ultrahigh bending toughness by using inorg. ionic oligomers, which can be useful in the fields of tough protective materials and energy absorbing materials.","[{'entity': 'MJ', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1316, 'end': 1318}]"

Herein, a multichannel calcium ion (Ca2+) nanomodulator (CaNMCUR+CDDP), i.e., a cisplatin (CDDP) and curcumin (CUR) co-incorporating calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticle, is prepd. by a facile one-pot strategy in a sealed container with in situ synthesized polydopamine (PDA) as a template to enhance Ca2+-overload-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer therapy.  After systemic administration, the PEGylated CaNMCUR+CDDP (PEGCaNMCUR+CDDP) selectively accumulates in tumor tissues, enters tumor cells, and induces multilevel destruction of mitochondria by the combined effects of burst Ca2+ release, Ca2+ efflux inhibition by CUR, and chemotherapeutic CDDP, thereby observably boosting mitochondria-targeted tumor inhibition.  Fluorescence imaging of CUR combined with photoacoustic imaging of PDA facilitates the visualization of the nanomodulator.  The facile and practical design of this multichannel Ca2+ nanomodulator will contribute to the development of multimodal bioimaging-guided organelle-targeted cancer therapy in the future.","[{'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 653, 'end': 662}]"

Ceria nanoparticles hold strong and recyclable reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging activity, have been applied to treat ROS-related diseases.  However, ceria nanoparticles can't selectively target mitochondria and the ultra-small ceria nanoparticles are easily agglomerated.  To overcome these shortcomings and improve therapeutic efficiency, we designed an ROS-responsive nano-drug delivery system combining mitochondria-targeting ceria nanoparticles with atorvastatin for acute kidney injury.  Methods: Ceria nanoparticles were modified with triphenylphosphine (TCeria NPs), followed by coating with ROS-responsive org. polymer (mPEG-TK-PLGA) and loaded atorvastatin (Atv/PTP-TCeria NPs).  Results: Atv/PTP-TCeria NPs could accumulate in kidneys and hold a great ability to ROS-responsively release drug and TCeria NPs could target mitochondria to eliminate excessive ROS.  In vitro study suggested Atv/PTP-TCeria NPs exhibited superior antioxidant and anti-apoptotic activity.  Conclusions: This ROS-responsive nano-drug delivery system combining mitochondria-targeting ceria nanoparticles with atorvastatin has favorable potentials in the sepsis-induced AKI therapy.","[{'entity': 'TK', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1333, 'end': 1335}]"

Triple neg. breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease characterized by high risk of relapse and development of resistance to different chemotherapy agents.  Several targeted therapies have been investigated in TNBC with modest results in clin. trials.  Among these, PI3K/AKT inhibitors have been evaluated in addn. to std. therapies, yielding conflicting results and making attempts on elucidating inherent mechanisms of resistance of great interest.  Increasing evidences suggest that PI3K/AKT inhibitors can induce autophagy in different cancers.  Autophagy represents a supposed mechanism of drug-resistance in aggressive tumors, like TNBC.  We, therefore, investigated if two PI3K/AKT inhibitors, ipatasertib and taselisib, could induce autophagy in breast cancer models, and whether chloroquine (CQ), a well known autophagy inhibitor, could potentiate ipatasertib and taselisib anti-cancer effect in combination with conventional chemotherapy.  The induction of autophagy after ipatasertib and taselisib treatment was evaluated in MDAMB231, MDAM468, MCF7, SKBR3 and MDAB361 breast cancer cell lines by assaying LC3-I conversion to LC3-II through immunoblotting and immunofluorescence.  Other autophagy-markers as p62/SQSTM1 and ATG5 were evaluated by immunoblotting.  Synergistic antiproliferative effect of double and triple combinations of ipatasertib/taselisib plus CQ and/or paclitaxel were evaluated by SRB assay and clonogenic assay.  Anti-apoptotic effect of double combination of ipatasertib/taselisib plus CQ was evaluated by increased cleaved-PARP by immunoblot and by Annexin V- flow cytometric anal.  In vivo expts. were performed on xenograft model of MDAMB231 in NOD/SCID mice.  Our results suggested that ipatasertib and taselisib induce increased autophagy signaling in different breast cancer models.  This effect was particularly evident in PI3K/AKT resistant TNBC cells, where the inhibition of autophagy by CQ potentiates the therapeutic effect of PI3K/AKT inhibitors in vitro and in vivo TNBC models, synergizing with taxane-based chemotherapy.  These data suggest that inhibition of authophagy with CQ could overcome mechanism of drug resistance to PI3K/AKT inhibitors plus paclitaxel in TNBC making the evaluation of such combinations in clin. trials warranted.","[{'entity': 'MDAMB231', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1409, 'end': 1417}, {'entity': 'MCF7', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1428, 'end': 1432}, {'entity': 'SKBR3', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1434, 'end': 1439}, {'entity': 'MDAMB231', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 2043, 'end': 2051}]"

However, the involvement of pyroptosis in the mechanism by which lobaplatin acts against colorectal cancer (CRC) is unclear.  Our study revealed that treatment with lobaplatin reduced the viability of HT-29 and HCT116 cells in a dose-dependent manner.  Morphologically, HT-29 and HCT116 cells treated with lobaplatin exhibited microscopic features of cell swelling and large bubbles emerging from the plasma membrane, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed multiple pores in the membrane.  GSDME, rather than GSDMD, was cleaved in lobaplatin-induced pyroptosis in HT-29 and HCT116 cells due to caspase-3 activation.  Knocking out GSDME switched lobaplatin-induced cell death from pyroptosis to apoptosis but did not affect lobaplatin-mediated inhibition of growth and tumour formation of HT-29 and HCT116 cells in vivo and in vitro.  Further investigation indicates that lobaplatin induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation and JNK phosphorylation.  NAC, a ROS scavenger, completely reversed the pyroptosis of lobaplatin-treated HT-29 and HCT116 and JNK phosphorylation.  Activated JNK recruited Bax to mitochondria, and thereby stimulated cytochrome c release to cytosol, followed by caspase-3/-9 cleavage and pyroptosis induction.  Therefore, in colon cancer cells, GSDME mediates lobaplatin-induced pyroptosis downstream of the ROS/JNK/Bax-mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and caspase-3/-9 activation.  Our study indicated that GSDME-dependent pyroptosis is an unrecognized mechanism by which lobaplatin eradicates neoplastic cells, which may have important implications for the clinical application of anticancer therapeutics.","[{'entity': 'HT', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 570, 'end': 572}, {'entity': 'HCT116', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 580, 'end': 586}, {'entity': 'HT', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 639, 'end': 641}, {'entity': 'HCT116', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 649, 'end': 655}, {'entity': 'HT', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 946, 'end': 948}, {'entity': 'HCT116', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 956, 'end': 962}, {'entity': 'HT', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1170, 'end': 1172}, {'entity': 'HCT116', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1180, 'end': 1186}, {'entity': 'HT', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1417, 'end': 1419}, {'entity': 'HCT116', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1427, 'end': 1433}]"

However, the key protein gasdermin E (GSDME, translated by DFNA5 gene) during caspase-3-mediated pyroptosis process is absent in most tumor cells because of the hypermethylation of DFNA5 (deafness autosomal dominant 5) gene.  Here, we develop a strategy of combining decitabine (DAC) with chemotherapy nano-drugs to trigger pyroptosis of tumor cells by epigenetics, further enhance immunol. effect of chemotherapy.  DAC is pre-performed with specific tumor-bearing mice for demethylation of DFNA5 gene in tumor cells.  Subsequently, a commonly used tumor-targeting nano-liposome loaded with cisplatin (LipoDDP) is used to administrate drugs for activating caspase-3 pathway in tumor cells and trigger pyroptosis.  Expts. demonstrate that the reversal of GSDME silencing in tumor cells is achieved, and facilitates the occurrence of pyroptosis.

Herein, we designed a type I aggregation-induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer-loaded biomimetic mesoporous organosilicon nanosystem (PMT) for precise depletion of CSC to prevent tumor recurrence after RT.  This PMT system is composed of a type I AIE photosensitizer (TBP-2) loaded mesoporous organosilicon nanoparticles (MON) with an outer platelet membrane.  The PMT system is able to specifically target CSC.  Intracellular glutathione activity leads to MON degrdn. and the release of TBP-2.  Type I photodynamic therapy is activated by exposure to white light, producing a large amt. of hydroxyl radicals to promote CSC death.  The results of in vivo expts. demonstrated specific removal of CSC following PMT treatment, with no tumor recurrence obsd. when combined with RT.  However, tumor recurrence was obsd. in mice that received RT only.  The expression of CSC markers was significantly reduced following PMT treatment.  We demonstrate the development of a system for the precise removal of CSC with good biosafety and high potential for clin. translation.

Many cancer patients display evidence of an endogenous T cell response against their tumors, yet fail to eliminate tumors unaided.  The failure of spontaneous immune-mediated tumor rejection is thought to be partially due to the action of neg. regulatory mechanisms (immune checkpoints) that inhibit key functional properties of tumor-infiltrating T cells.  Checkpoint blockade immunotherapies have demonstrated notable therapeutic success by overcoming tumor-induced T cell inhibition; however, their efficacy is poor when patients lack evidence of a spontaneous T cell response.  Innate immune agonists may promote priming and recruitment of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and are gaining traction as a cancer immunotherapy approach.

Unfortunately, opsonins are also adsorbed.  These proteins are immediately recognized by the phagocyte system with rapid clearance of the NPs from the bloodstream.  Polyethyleneglycol (PEG) coating of NPs (PEGylation) is the most efficient anti-opsonization strategy.  Linear chains of PEG, grafted onto the NP surface, are able to create steric hindrance, resulting in a significant inhibition of protein adsorption and less recognition by macrophages.  However, excessive PEGylation can lead to a strong inhibition of cellular uptake and less efficient binding with protein targets, reducing the potential of the delivery system.  To reach a compromise in this regard we employed a multi-component (MC) lipid system with uncommon properties of cell uptake and endosomal escape and increasing length of PEG chains.  Nano liq. chromatog. coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) anal. allowed us to accurately det. the corona compn. showing that apolipoproteins are the most abundant class in the corona and that increasing the PEG length reduced the protein adsorption and the liposomal surface affinity for apolipoproteins.  Due to the abundance of apolipoproteins, we exploited the ""protein corona effect"" to deliver cationic liposome-human plasma complexes to human prostate cancer PC3 cells that express a high level of scavenger receptor class B type 1 to evaluate the cellular uptake efficiency of the systems used.  Combining laser scanning confocal microscopy with flow cytometry anal. in PC3 cells we demonstrated that MC-PEG2k is the best compromise between an anti-opsonization strategy and active targeting and could be a promising candidate to treat prostate cancer in vivo.","[{'entity': 'PC3', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 2086, 'end': 2089}, {'entity': 'PC3', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 2298, 'end': 2301}]"

However, of the thirteen PSs currently approved for the treatment of cancer over more than 10 countries, only two contain a metal ion.  This fact is rather surprising considering that nowadays around 50% of conventional chemotherapies involve the use of cisplatin and other platinum-contg. drugs.  In this perspective article, we review the opportunities brought by the use of Ru(II) complexes as PSs in PDT.  In addn., we also present the recent achievements in the application of Ru(II) complexes in photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT).  In this strategy, the presence of oxygen is not required to achieve cell toxicity.  This is of significance since tumors are generally hypoxic.

Since the initial introduction of ruthenium (Ru) polypyridyl complex, a no. of attempts at structural evolution have been conducted to improve efficacy.  Among them, half-sandwich Ru-arene complexes have been the most prominent as an anticancer platform.  Such complexes have clearly shown superior anticancer profiles such as increased selectivity toward cancer cells and ameliorating toxicity against normal cells compared to existing Pt-based anticancers.  Currently, several Ru complexes are under human clin. trials.

Herein, we examine the way in which these two pathways influence photocytotoxicity in normoxia and in hypoxia using the [Ru(dmp)2(IP-nT)]2+ series (where dmp = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline and IP-nT = imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline tethered to n = 0-4 thiophene rings) to switch the dominant excited state from the metal-based 3MC state in the case of Ru-phen-Ru-1T to the ligand-based 3ILCT state for Ru-3T and Ru-4T.  Ru-phen-Ru-1T, having dominant 3MC states and the largest photosubstitution quantum yields, are inactive in both normoxia and hypoxia.  Ru-3T and Ru-4T, with dominant 3IL/3ILCT states and long triplet lifetimes (τTA = 20-25 μs), have the poorest photosubstitution quantum yields, yet are extremely active.  In the best instances, Ru-4T exhibit attomolar phototoxicity toward SKMEL28 cells in normoxia and picomolar in hypoxia, with phototherapeutic index values in normoxia of 105-1012 and 103-106 in hypoxia.  While maximizing excited-state deactivation through photodissociative 3MC states did not result in bonafide dual-action PDT/PCT agents, the study has produced the most potent photosensitizer we know of to date.  The extraordinary photosensitizing capacity of Ru-3T and Ru-4T may stem from a combination of very efficient 1O2 prodn. and possibly complementary type I pathways via 3ILCT excited states.","[{'entity': 'SKMEL28', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1314, 'end': 1321}]"

Yet, most existing drugs inhibit only cancer cell proliferation.  Historically, the reason is the much later elucidation of the mol. biol. of metastasis vs. that of the early steps in transformation.  Because the mols. that drive the dissemination of malignant cells are shared among cancers, drugs that inhibit their functions will be broadly beneficial.  There are two complementary anti-metastasis strategies, the prevention of cancer cell dissemination and the suppression of already existing metastases.  To accelerate the availability of potentially life-saving anti-metastasis agents several adjustments must be made.  The risk tolerance in drug trials needs to increase with a worsening prognosis.  Clin. trials of drug mols. that prevent cancer dissemination need to be approved for use right after diagnosis, not after failure of std.-of-care therapies.  For agents that treat existing metastases, the clin. trial system needs to be modernized.  Because cancer metastasis is often fatal, improved and innovative approaches to anti-metastasis drugs are eminently suited to play a lead role in changing the stds. of drug development.","[{'entity': 'NY', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 26, 'end': 28}]"

Cells after exposure to the nanoparticles showed increased cell contractility with significantly impaired wound healing capability however without any apparent cytotoxicity.  We showed the mechanism is through nanoparticle-mediated massive disruption of the intracellular microtubule assembly, thereby triggering a pos. feedback that promoted stronger substrate adhesions thus leading to limited cell motility.","[{'entity': 'TR146', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 222, 'end': 227}]"

39448366,243,"Jeffrey 8325-8345 ANCAC3 1936-0851 Many nanocarrier cancer therapeutics currently under development, as well as those used in the clin. setting, rely upon the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect to passively accumulate in the tumor microenvironment and kill cancer cells.  In leukemia, where leukemogenic stem cells and their progeny circulate within the peripheral blood or bone marrow, the EPR effect may not be operative.  Thus, for leukemia therapeutics, it is essential to target and bind individual circulating cells.  Here, we investigate mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN)-supported lipid bilayers (protocells), an emerging class of nanocarriers, and establish the synthesis conditions and lipid bilayer compn. needed to achieve highly monodisperse protocells that remain stable in complex media as assessed in vitro by dynamic light scattering and cryo-electron microscopy and ex ovo by direct imaging within a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model.  We show that for vesicle fusion conditions where the lipid surface area exceeds the external surface area of the MSN and the ionic strength exceeds 20 mM, we form monosized protocells (polydispersity index <0.1) on MSN cores with varying size, shape, and pore size, whose conformal zwitterionic supported lipid bilayer confers excellent stability as judged by circulation in the CAM and minimal opsonization in vivo in a mouse model.  Having established protocell formulations that are stable colloids, we further modified them with anti-EGFR antibodies as targeting agents and reverified their monodispersity and stability.  Then, using intravital imaging in the CAM, we directly obsd. in real time the progression of selective targeting of individual leukemia cells (using the established REH leukemia cell line transduced with EGFR) and delivery of a model cargo.  Overall, we have established the effectiveness of the protocell platform for individual cell targeting and delivery needed for leukemia and other disseminated disease.","[{'entity': 'REH', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1771, 'end': 1774}]"
39448366,333,"MSNs were functionalized with aminopropyl groups through postsynthesis.  MSNs as well as the resulting functionalized MSNs were investigated as matrixes for loading and release of the model drug telmisartan (TEL).  The effects of different pore sizes and surface chem. groups on TEL uptake and release were systematically studied using SEM, TEM, nitrogen adsorption, x-ray diffraction, Fourier transformation IR spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric anal. (TGA), and HPLC.  The total pore vol. and the pore diam. of MSNs were the two main factors limiting the max. drug load capacity.  MSNs allow a very high drug loading of about 60% in wt.  The release rate of TEL from MSNs with a pore diam. of 12.9 nm was found to be effectively increased and the release rate of TEL from the functionalized MSNs was effectively controlled compared with that from the unmodified MSNs.

Acetylation, a key component in post-translational modification regulated by HATs and HDACs, is relevant to many crucial cellular contexts in organisms.  Based on crucial pharmacophore patterns and the structure of targeted proteins, HAT inhibitors are designed and modified for higher affinity and better bioactivity.  However, there are still some challenges, such as cell permeability, selectivity, toxicity and synthetic availability, which limit the improvement of HAT inhibitors.  So far, only few HAT inhibitors have been approved for commercialization, indicating the urgent need for more successful and effective structure-based drug design and synthetic strategies.  Here, we summarized three classes of HAT inhibitors based on their sources and structural scaffolds, emphasizing on their synthetic methods and structure-activity relationships and mol. mechanisms, hoping to facilitate the development and further application of HAT inhibitors.","[{'entity': 'SAS', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 379, 'end': 382}]"

39462900,267,"Current cancer treatments of solid tumors such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have yet to produce effective therapeutic results due to non-specific targeting.  This has led to many complications, such as toxicities in cancer patients.  The ability of natural compds. in inducing programmed cell death (apoptosis), a process dysregulated in cancer cells, has been extensively studied in recent studies.  This study assessed the anti-proliferative activity of violacein in a no. of human cancer cell lines under normal and hypoxic conditions.  Furthermore, we investigated its effects in a tumor-bearing s.c. mouse model.  We also examd. the ability of a tumor-targeting Salmonella strain to produce violacein for local delivery within the tumor microenvironment.  The results showed that hypoxia significantly increased the cytotoxic effects of violacein.  The most significant redn. in the IC50 was in the HT29 (12.6-fold) and HCT116 (4.8-fold) colon cancer cell lines, HN5 head and neck squamous carcinoma cell line (6.5-fold), and MCF-7 breast ductal carcinoma cell line (4-fold).  Among the cell lines tested for active caspase-3/7 activity, violacein only increased caspase-3/7 activity in the A549 non-small lung cancer cell line.  In vivo efficacy of violacein showed that HN5 tumor-bearing mice had regressed tumors during the treatment period and survival increased.  The results also showed that transfer of the violacein biosynthetic cluster into the oncolytic strain VNP20009 of Salmonella resulted in the prodn. of active violacein, suggesting targeted delivery of violacein by VNP20009.  Taken together, our study has shown that hypoxia synergises the effects of violacein and the results from the in vivo administration of violacein require further investigation of violacein as an anticancer chemotherapeutic.","[{'entity': 'HT29', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 909, 'end': 913}, {'entity': 'HCT116', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 930, 'end': 936}, {'entity': 'A549', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1201, 'end': 1205}]"

39474658,273,"Scientific Reports SRCEC3 2045-2322 Although doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective anti-cancer drug with cytotoxicity in a variety of different tumors, its effectiveness in treating glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is constrained by insufficient penetration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB).  In this study, biocompatible magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) stabilized with trimethoxysilylpropyl-ethylenediamine triacetic acid (EDT) were developed as a carrier of DOX for GBM chemotherapy.  The DOX-loaded EDT-IONPs (DOX-EDT-IONPs) released DOX within 4 days with the capability of an accelerated release in acidic microenvironments.  The DOX-loaded EDT-IONPs (DOX-EDT-IONPs) demonstrated an efficient uptake in mouse brain-derived microvessel endothelial, bEnd.3, Madin-Darby canine kidney transfected with multi-drug resistant protein 1 (MDCK-MDR1), and human U251 GBM cells.  The DOX-EDT-IONPs could augment DOX's uptake in U251 cells by 2.8-fold and significantly inhibited U251 cell proliferation.  Moreover, the DOX-EDT-IONPs were found to be effective in apoptotic-induced GBM cell death (over 90%) within 48 h of treatment.  Gene expression studies revealed a significant downregulation of TOP II and Ku70, crucial enzymes for DNA repair and replication, as well as MiR-155 oncogene, concomitant with an upregulation of caspase 3 and tumor suppressors i.e., p53, MEG3 and GAS5, in U251 cells upon treatment with DOX-EDT-IONPs.  An in vitro MDCK-MDR1-GBM co-culture model was used to assess the BBB permeability and anti-tumor activity of the DOX-EDT-IONPs and DOX treatments.  While DOX-EDT-IONP showed improved permeability of DOX across MDCK-MDR1 monolayers compared to DOX alone, cytotoxicity in U251 cells was similar in both treatment groups.  Using a cadherin binding peptide (ADTC5) to transiently open tight junctions, in combination with an external magnetic field, significantly enhanced both DOX-EDT-IONP permeability and cytotoxicity in the MDCK-MDR1-GBM co-culture model.  Therefore, the combination of magnetic enhanced convective diffusion and the cadherin binding peptide for transiently opening the BBB tight junctions are expected to enhance the efficacy of GBM chemotherapy using the DOX-EDT-IONPs.  In general, the developed approach enables the chemotherapeutic to overcome both BBB and multidrug resistance (MDR) glioma cells while providing site-specific magnetic targeting.","[{'entity': '48 h', 'type': 'Incubation Time (hour)', 'start': 1116, 'end': 1120}]"

Fe3O4-SAS@PLT are built from sulfasalazine (SAS)-loaded mesoporous magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4) and platelet (PLT) membrane camouflage and triggered a ferroptotic cell death via inhibiting the glutamate-cystine antiporter system Xc- pathway.  Fe3O4-SAS @ PLT-mediated ferroptosis significantly improves the efficacy of programmed cell death 1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy and achieves a continuous tumor elimination in a mouse model of 4T1 metastatic tumors.  Proteomics studies reveal that Fe3O4-SAS @ PLT-mediated ferroptosis could not only induce tumor-specific immune response but also efficiently repolarize macrophages from immunosuppressive M2 phenotype to antitumor M1 phenotype.  Therefore, the concomitant of Fe3O4-SAS @ PLT-mediated ferroptosis with immunotherapy are expected to provide great potential in the clin. treatment of tumor metastasis.","[{'entity': 'SAS', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 660, 'end': 663}, {'entity': 'SAS', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 857, 'end': 860}, {'entity': 'SAS', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 895, 'end': 898}, {'entity': 'SAS', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1102, 'end': 1105}, {'entity': 'SAS', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1356, 'end': 1359}, {'entity': 'SAS', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1584, 'end': 1587}]"

In solid tumors, 5-40 % of the tumor mass consists of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and there is usually a correlation between the number of TAMs and poor prognosis, depending on the tumor type.  TAMs usually resemble M2 macrophages.  Unlike M1-macrophages which have pro-inflammatory and anti-cancer functions, M2-macrophages are immunosuppressive, contribute to the matrix-remodeling, and hence favor tumor growth.  The role of TAMs is not fully understood in breast cancer progression.  METHODS:  Macrophage infiltration (CD68) and activation status (HLA-DRIIα, CD163) were evaluated in a large cohort of human primary breast tumors (562 tissue microarray samples), by immunohistochemistry and scored by automated image analysis algorithms.  Survival between groups was compared using the Kaplan-Meier life-table method and a Cox multivariate proportional hazards model.  Macrophage education by breast cancer cells was assessed by ex vivo differentiation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the presence or absence of breast cancer cell conditioned media (MDA-MB231, MCF-7 or T47D cell lines) and M1 or M2 inducing cytokines (respectively IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-10).  Obtained macrophages were analyzed by flow cytometry (CD14, CD16, CD64, CD86, CD200R and CD163), ELISA (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, monocyte colony stimulating factor M-CSF) and zymography (matrix metalloproteinase 9, MMP-9).  RESULTS:  Clinically, we found that high numbers of CD163(+) M2-macrophages were strongly associated with fast proliferation, poor differentiation, estrogen receptor negativity and histological ductal type (p<0.001) in the studied cohort of human primary breast tumors.  We demonstrated ex vivo that breast cancer cell-secreted factors modulate macrophage differentiation toward the M2 phenotype.  Furthermore, the more aggressive mesenchymal-like cell line MDA-MB231, which secretes high levels of M-CSF, skews macrophages toward the more immunosuppressive M2c subtype.  CONCLUSIONS:  This study demonstrates that human breast cancer cells influence macrophage differentiation and that TAM differentiation status correlates with recurrence free survival, thus further emphasizing that TAMs can similarly affect therapy efficacy and patient outcome.","[{'entity': 'T47D', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1646, 'end': 1650}]"

A class of FAP inhibitors (FAPIs) with a N-(4-quinolinoyl)-Gly-(2-cyanopyrrolidine) scaffold were developed, which displayed nanomolar affinity and high selectivity.  Compared with 90Y, 177Lu, 225Ac, and 188Re, 211At seems to be more favored as a therapeutic candidate for FAPI tracers which have fast washout and short retention in tumor sites.  Thus, the current study reported the synthesis of two FAPI precursors for 211At and 131I labeling and the preliminary evaluation of 131I-labeled FAPI analogs for cancer theranostics.  FAPI variants with stannyl precursors were successfully synthesized and labeled with 131I using a radioiododestannylation reaction.  Two radioactive tracers were obtained with high radiochem. purity over 99% and good radiochem. yields of 58.2 ± 1.78 and 59.5 ± 4.44% for 131I-FAPI-02 and 131I-FAPI-04, resp.

Compared to 131I-FAPI-02, 131I-FAPI-04 exhibited higher affinity, more intracellular uptake, and longer retention time in vitro.  Biodistribution studies revealed that both tracers were mainly excreted through the kidneys as well as the hepatobiliary pathway due to their high lipophilicity.  In addn., higher accumulation, longer dwell time, and increased tumor-to-organ ratios were achieved by 131I-FAPI-04, which was clearly demonstrated by SPECT/CT imaging.  Furthermore, intratumor injection of 131I-FAPI-04 significantly suppressed the tumor growth in U87MG xenograft mice without significant toxicity obsd.

Platinum-based drugs cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin are widely used for chemotherapeutic eradication of cancer.  However, the side effects of platinum drugs, such as lack of selectivity, high systemic toxicity, and drug resistance, seriously limit their clin. application.  With advancements in nanotechnol. and chem. synthesis, Pt-based anti-cancer drugs have made great progress in cancer therapy in recent years.  Many strategies relied on the anti-cancer mechanism similar to cisplatin and achieved some success by modifying existing platinum drugs.  Pt-based nanodrugs, such as platinum nanoclusters, have novel anti-cancer mechanisms and great potential in tumor-targeted therapy and have shown promising results in clin. application.  In this review, we systematically explored the development of first-line platinum chemotherapy drugs in the clinic and their anti-cancer mechanisms.  We also summarize the progress of Pt-based anti-cancer drug application in cancer therapy, emphasizing their modification to enhance the anti-tumor effect.  Finally, we address challenges faced by platinum chemotherapy drugs, esp.

The keratins are the typical intermediate filament proteins of epithelia, showing an outstanding degree of mol. diversity.  Heteropolymeric filaments are formed by pairing of type I and type II mols.  In humans 54 functional keratin genes exist.  They are expressed in highly specific patterns related to the epithelial type and stage of cellular differentiation.  About half of all keratins-including numerous keratins characterized only recently-are restricted to the various compartments of hair follicles.  As part of the epithelial cytoskeleton, keratins are important for the mech. stability and integrity of epithelial cells and tissues.  Moreover, some keratins also have regulatory functions and are involved in intracellular signaling pathways, e.g. protection from stress, wound healing, and apoptosis.  Applying the new consensus nomenclature, this article summarizes, for all human keratins, their cell type and tissue distribution and their functional significance in relation to transgenic mouse models and human hereditary keratin diseases.  Furthermore, since keratins also exhibit characteristic expression patterns in human tumors, several of them (notably K5, K7, K8/K18, K19, and K20) have great importance in immunohistochem. tumor diagnosis of carcinomas, in particular of unclear metastases and in precise classification and subtyping.  Future research might open further fields of clin. application for this remarkable protein family.","[{'entity': 'K5', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1318, 'end': 1320}]"

39499621,486,"133-145 ONCNES 0950-9232 Nature Publishing Group We have previously demonstrated that crosstalk between lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) facilitates breast cancer proliferation.  However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown.  Here, we report that expression of HDAC5 and LSD1 proteins were pos. correlated in human breast cancer cell lines and tissue specimens of primary breast tumors.  Protein expression of HDAC5 and LSD1 was significantly increased in primary breast cancer specimens in comparison with matched-normal adjacent tissues.  Using HDAC5 deletion mutants and co-immunopptn. studies, we showed that HDAC5 phys. interacted with the LSD1 complex through its domain contg. nuclear localization sequence and phosphorylation sites.  Although the in vitro acetylation assays revealed that HDAC5 decreased LSD1 protein acetylation, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated HDAC5 knockdown did not alter the acetylation level of LSD1 in MDA-MB-231 cells.  Overexpression of HDAC5 stabilized LSD1 protein and decreased the nuclear level of H3K4me1/me2 in MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas loss of HDAC5 by siRNA diminished LSD1 protein stability and demethylation activity.  We further demonstrated that HDAC5 promoted the protein stability of USP28, a bona fide deubiquitinase of LSD1.  Overexpression of USP28 largely reversed HDAC5-KD-induced LSD1 protein degrdn., suggesting a role of HDAC5 as a pos. regulator of LSD1 through upregulation of USP28 protein.  Depletion of HDAC5 by shRNA hindered cellular proliferation, induced G1 cell cycle arrest, and attenuated migration and colony formation of breast cancer cells.  A rescue study showed that increased growth of MDA-MB-231 cells by HDAC5 overexpression was reversed by concurrent LSD1 depletion, indicating that tumor-promoting activity of HDAC5 is an LSD1 dependent function.  Moreover, overexpression of HDAC5 accelerated cellular proliferation and promoted acridine mutagen ICR191-induced transformation of MCF10A cells.  Taken together, these results suggest that HDAC5 is crit. in regulating LSD1 protein stability through post-translational modification, and the HDAC5-LSD1 axis has an important role in promoting breast cancer development and progression.","[{'entity': 'KD', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 1377, 'end': 1379}, {'entity': 'MCF10A', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 2012, 'end': 2018}]"

In this study, we investigated the protective effects and possible mechanisms of hesperetin on cisplatin-induced kidney damage.  In vitro, hesperetin significantly attenuated oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by reducing ROS levels in cisplatin-treated HK-2 cells.  Simultaneously, hesperetin activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway and regulated its downstream genes, including NQO1 and HO-1.  In vivo, hesperetin could significantly attenuate cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr).  Furthermore, hesperetin clarifies cisplatin-induced oxidative stress by reducing MDA/MPO levels and increasing SOD/GSH levels.  In addn., from the histopathol. anal. of the kidney, hesperetin significantly reduced the nephrotoxicity caused by cisplatin compared with the cisplatin group.  Moreover, western blotting of renal tissue revealed that hesperetin activates Nrf2 in a dose-dependent manner, attenuates the MAPK signaling pathway against inflammation, and inhibits the expression of apoptotic proteins to protect kidneys from AKI caused by cisplatin.

39506058,16,"A disintegrin and metalloproteases 17 (ADAM17) is overexpressed in many tumors such as lung, breast and ovarian cancer and plays a crucial role in tumor proliferation, progression and migration 18 19 20 . Ectodomain shedding releases over 80 different substrates that activate intracellular signaling cascades such as the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway or Notch signaling 21 22 . The release of activators of the EGF receptor, such as amphiregulin, HBEGF, TGFα, which trigger proliferation and suppress apoptosis, has been studied most extensively 23 24 . Because ADAM17 is upstream of the EGFR, PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways, which are key players in chemoresistance, Kyula et al. were able to link ADAM17 to various resistance mechanisms 25 We recently demonstrated that ADAM17 plays a critical role in the development of cisplatin resistance 26 27 .

If fewer RTKs are proteolytically cleaved, they accumulate at the cell surface and activate alternative signaling pathways that induce proliferation and contribute to tumor progression . Upstream of these signaling pathways is the matrix metalloprotease ADAM17, cleaving a variety of different substrates, of which at least six substrates bind to growth factors, such as the EGFR 39 40 . By activating EGFR signaling, but also by shedding RTKs on the cell surface, ADAM17 plays a crucial role in mediating intracellular signal transduction and promotes tumor proliferation, migration and metastasis 41 42 43 .

Here, we introduce a new class of amyloid fibril-based peptide hydrogels as a versatile biomimetic ECM scaffold for 3D cell culture and homogenous tumor spheroid modeling.  We show that these amyloid fibril-based hydrogels are thixotropic and allow cancer cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration.  All seven designed hydrogels support 3D cell culture with five different cancer cell lines forming spheroid with necrotic core and upregulation of the cancer biomarkers.  We further developed the homogenous, single spheroid using the drop cast method and the data suggest that all hydrogels support the tumor spheroid formation but with different necrotic core diams.  The detailed gene expression anal. of MCF7 spheroid by microarray suggested the involvement of pro-oncogenes and significant regulatory pathways responsible for tumor spheroid formation.  Further, using breast tumor tissue from a mouse xenograft model, we show that selected amyloid hydrogels support the formation of tumor spheroids with a well-defined necrotic core, cancer-assocd. gene expression, higher drug resistance, and tumor heterogeneity reminiscent of the original tumor.  Altogether, we have developed an easy-to-use, rapid, cost-effective, and scalable platform for generating in vitro cancer models for the screening of anti-cancer therapeutics and developing personalized medicine.","[{'entity': 'MCF7', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 894, 'end': 898}]"

Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic regulated cell death caused by iron accumulation and subsequent lipid peroxidn.  However, the key pathway for UPS to promote ferroptotic cell death is still poorly understood.  Here, we screened 571 UPS-related E1, E2, and E3 genes in a human pancreatic cancer cell line (PANC1) and identified the upregulation of NEDD4-like E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (NEDD4L) as a novel ferroptosis suppressor.  Mass spectrometry anal. further showed that lactotransferrin (LTF), an iron-binding transport protein, is a direct NEDD4L-binding protein.  Consequently, NEDD4L-mediated LTF protein degrdn. inhibits intracellular iron accumulation and subsequent oxidative damage-mediated ferroptotic cell death in various cancer cells.

Unique structure, characteristic reactivity, and facile synthesis of metal complexes have made them efficient ligands in drug development research.  Among them, rhodium complexes have a limited history and there are a few discussions about their biol. activities documented in the literature.  However, investigation of kinetically inert rhodium complexes has recently attracted lots of attention and esp. there are various evidences on their anti-cancer activity.  It seems that they can be investigated as a versatile surrogates or candidates for the existing drugs which do not affect selectively or suffer from various side effects.  In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the use of mononuclear rhodium (III) organometallo drugs due to its versatile structurally important aspects to inhibit various enzymes.  It has been demonstrated that organometallic Rh complexes profiting from both org. and inorg. aspects have shown more potent biol. activities than classical inorg. compartments.  In this respect, smart design, use of the appropriate org. ligands, and efficient and user-friendly synthesis of organometallic Rh complexes have played crucial roles in the inducing desirable biol. activities.  In this review, we focused on the recent advances published on the bioactivity of Rh (III/II/I) complexes esp. inhibitory activity, from 2013 till now.  Accordingly, considering the structure-activity relationship (SAR), the effect of oxidn. state (+1, +2, and +3) and geometry (dimer or monomer complexes with coordination no. of 4 and 6) of Rh complexes as well as various ligands on in vitro and in vivo studies was comprehensively discussed.","[{'entity': 'SAS', 'type': 'CellLine', 'start': 158, 'end': 161}]"
