Here, a newly developed size-changeable collagenase-modified polymer micelle is employed to enhance the penetration and retention of nanomedicine in deep tumor tissue.  The TCPPB micelle is first formed by self-assembly of maleimide-terminated poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(β-amino ester) (MAL-PEG-PBAE) and succinic anhydride-modified cisplatin-conjugated poly(ε-caprolactone)-block-poly(ethylene oxide)-triphenylphosphonium (CDDP-PCL-PEO-TPP).  Next, Col-TCPPB NPs are prepd. through a ""click"" chem. combination of thiolated collagenase and maleimide groups on TCPPB micelle.  Finally, biocompatible chondroitin sulfate (CS) is coated to obtain CS/Col-TCPPB NPs for avoiding collagenase inactivation in blood circulation.  In tumor acidic microenvironment, the hydrophobic PBAE segments of the resultant micelles become hydrophilic, leading to a dissocn. and subsequent dissoln. of partial collagenase-contg. components (Col-PEG-PBAE) from NPs.  The dissolved Col-PEG-PBAE promotes the digestion of collagen fibers in tumor tissue like a scavenger, which enhances the NPs penetration.  Simultaneously, the increased hydrophilicity of residual Col-PEG-PBAE in the micellar matrix causes an expansion of the NPs, resulting in an enhanced intratumoral retention.  In tumor cells, the NPs target to release the cisplatin drugs into mitochondria, achieving an excellent anticancer efficacy.","[{'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 530, 'end': 539}, {'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 1503, 'end': 1512}]"

How to maximize the tumor accumulation is still a great challenge in the development of nanocarriers.  Here, we developed a cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe-Lys peptide (cRGD) modified and near-IR (NIR) light triggered disintegratable liposomal nanoplatform (PAM/Pt@IcLipo), where photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) was loaded in the out layer and polyamindoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers grafting cisplatin prodrug (PAM/Pt) were encapsulated inside.  The cRGD ligands render the liposomes to target αvβ3 integrin receptors overexpressed by vascular endothelial cells in tumor tissues.  Long blood circulation can be achieved owing to the relative large size (∼162 nm) of the liposomes.  When irradiated by NIR light locally at tumor site, ICG heating detonated the thermosensitive liposomes to release the small sized PAM/Pt nanoparticles (∼8.6 nm), which were capable of penetrating into the deep tumor tissue.  The in vivo results also showed that the PAM/Pt@IcLipo could significantly improve the penetration of cisplatin drug in deep tumor tissues under NIR light irradn., resulting in an excellent antitumor activity.  This nanoplatform solved the dilemma of long blood circulation of large sized nanoparticles and deep penetration of small sized nanoparticles, opening up a new strategy in the development of nanomedicines for cancer therapy.","[{'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 824, 'end': 833}, {'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 1442, 'end': 1451}]"

Both carriers were taken up by cells mainly via macropinocytosis, whereas only the HA-R8/GALA-MEND was partially internalized into cells via a CD44-mediated pathway.

In the present study, we developed a chemo-photothermal theranostic platform based on polydopamine (PDA)-coated gold nanorods (GNRs).  The PDA coating was thin; however, it significantly suppressed the cytotoxicity of the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide template and allowed high cisplatin loading efficiency, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide (c(RGDyC)) conjugation, and chelator-free iodine-125 labeling (RGD-125IPt-PDA@GNRs).  While loaded cisplatin was released in a pH-sensitive manner, labeled 125I was outstandingly stable under biol. conditions.  RGD-125IPt-PDA@GNRs had a high specificity for αvβ3 integrin, and consequently, they could selectively accumulate in tumors, as revealed by single photon emission computed tomog./CT imaging, and in target tumor angiogenic vessels, as shown by high-resoln. photoacoustic imaging.  As RGD-125IPt-PDA@GNRs targets tumor angiogenesis, it is a highly potent tumor therapy.  Combined chemo-photothermal therapy with probes could thoroughly ablate tumors and inhibit tumor relapse via a synergistic antitumor effect.  Our studies demonstrated that RGD-125IPt-PDA@GNRs is a robust platform for image-guided, chemo-thermal tumor therapy with outstanding synergistic tumor killing and relapse inhibition effects.","[{'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 778, 'end': 787}, {'entity': 'Cisplatin', 'type': 'Drug', 'start': 952, 'end': 961}]"

Here, a self-organized three-dimensional (3D) graphene electrode processed by pulsed laser deposition with thermal annealing is reported.  This substrate shows great performance in electron transfer kinetics regarding ferrocene redox probes in soln.  A robust electrografting strategy for covalently attaching a redox probe onto these graphene electrodes is also reported.  The modification protocol consists of a combination of diazonium salt electrografting and click chem.  An alkyne-terminated Ph ring is 1st electrografted onto the self-organized 3-dimensional graphene electrode by in situ electrochem. redn. of 4-ethynylphenyl diazonium.  Then the ethynylphenyl-modified surface efficiently reacts with the redox probe bearing a terminal azide moiety (2-azidoethyl ferrocene) by CuI-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddn.  The authors' modification strategy applied to 3-dimensional graphene electrodes was analyzed by at. force microscopy, SEM, Raman spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and XPS.  For XPS chem. surface anal., special attention was paid to the distribution and chem. state of Fe and N to highlight the functionalization of the graphene-based substrate by electrochem. grafting a ferrocene deriv.  Dense grafting was obsd., offering 4.9 × 10-10 mol cm-2 surface coverage and showing a stable signal over 22 days.  The electrografting was performed as multilayers, which offers higher ferrocene loading than a dense monolayer on a flat surface.
