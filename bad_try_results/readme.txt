Some horrible results due to imbalance of labels. 

For small-batch-data with 30 papers: 
# Entity Type Distribution in NER Dataset

| Entity Type                        | Count |
|------------------------------------|-------|
| CellLine                           | 494   |
| Drug                               | 66    |
| Incubation Time (hour)             | 23    |
| Cell Density (cells/well)          | 4     |
